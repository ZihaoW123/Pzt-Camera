# Pzt-Camera
The PZT is controlled to move at a fixed step length, and a series of images can be obtained by taking pictures with an industrial camera after each movement, which can be used to shoot a series of interference fringes with the same position difference.

控制Pzt使其以固定步长移动，每次移动后使用工业相机进行拍照，以此获得一系列图像，可用于拍摄一系列等相同位差的干涉条纹。
